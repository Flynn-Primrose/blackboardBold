# blackboardBold
A project to provide simple class definitions for common mathematical objects. 

The name refers to the convention of using Blackboard Bold capital letters to denote different mathematical sets. Off the top of my head we have:

- N for the natural numbers
- Z for the integers. From the german 'Zahl'
- Q for rational numbers
- R for real numbers
- C for complex numbers
